These Symbiotes have been now revealed to react with **Black Blood**. Branded as failure by Gaya Corp, the primary reason of failure for these symbiotic parasite was due to their lack of materials to synthesize long lasting enough body components that would be durable enough. Having **Black Blood** which contains copious level amount of pure, well refined carbon mass, these Symbiotes can now synthesize powerful body enhancements, at the cost of your humanity.

An individual can have *Body Slots* equal to their CON mod. A Symbiote may freely devolve redundant evolutions to support new ones. Temporary bonuses that can be removed does not provide additional *Body Slots.*

Due to their flammable nature, for each *Body Slot* used to enhance oneself, the infected takes 25% additional fire damage.

## Infection Level 1 - Early Stage

### Black Carapace

**Requirements:** *1 Body Slot*

Grants additional *Second Wind* charge, when *Second Wind* is triggered, immediately heal to 10 hp.

### Improved Respiratory System

**Requirements:** *1 Body Slot*

Grants ability to *Recover*, allowing the user to restore Dodge to maximum as immediate action, once per day.

### Robust Leg Muscle Structure

**Requirements:** *1 Body Slot*

Grants +3 bonus to acrobatics check.

### Self Preservation Nullification Hormones

**Requirements:** *2 Body Slots*

When brought below 25% health, the surge of adrenaline and hormones shut down all the limiters of your body parts, operating beyond safe capacity. Every round, you take (level)x2 lethal damage, however, you gain +6 to all your physical ability scores.

You stop taking damage when you fall below 0 hp. You do not go unconscious when below 0 hp. You are not staggered when at exactly 0 hp.

### Carbon Monocompound Arms

**Requirements:** *2 Body Slots*

Grants additional +2 AC against melee. Unarmed attacks now deal lethal damage. The arm is considered to have hardness of 10.

### Hydro-carbon Polymelia

**Requirements:** *3 Body Slots*

A giant tendril spurts out from the infected's back, granting them an extra limb with a reach of 15 ft. The tendril is pure muscle mass and can be used as bludgeon, dealing 1d12+CON mod physical damage. It is also articulate enough to help the infected climb, leap distances and other miscellaneous stuff.

This extra limb grants additional 8 HP and has hardness of 10.

> Overtime, Polymelia assimilates with the host, returning the Body Slot cost. **However, once fully returned, the Polymelia evolution cannot be removed.**

### Infector Aspect

**Requirements:** *3 Body Slots, WIS 16*

The infected gains 6 small, lesser tendrils. They can attempt to pin humanoids using 1d20+BAB+WIS mod CMB check. When pinned, as full round action, the Infector can either:

1. Link the victim as Dummy, attaching umbelical cord. The cord is extremely resilient, however, it can only extend upto 30 ft. The Dummy becomes one with the Infector, listening to every command given by the Infector unconditionally. Severing the cord frees the Dummy. Upto WIS mod Dummies can be maintained. New Dummy exceeding this limit frees the oldest one.
2. Infect the victim with Level 1 Infection.
3. Inject Bloodlings to grow inside the victim, eventually killing the host to spawn 2d2 Bloodlings. They obey the Infector unconditionally. Upto WIS mod x 4 Bloodlings can be controlled. Any Bloodling exceeding the limit goes feral.
