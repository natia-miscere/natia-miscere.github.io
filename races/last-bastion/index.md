## Arcadians

Arcadians are living constructs of war, heralds of battle. They are forged from mud mixed with metallic bacterias, which allows them to "grow" in power just like living creatures as they grow hardened and bulkier.

However, as they progress in age, their texture and hardness follows these metal in order: bronze, iron, steel/cold iron, mithral and finally, adamantite.

**Alignment and Religion**: Arcadians are highly isolationist, usually murdering any trespassers of their territory. However, this does not mean they see no value in virtues.

They do not worship any specific deities, but they seek death by glorious combat, and most of them gravitate towards lawful alignments.
