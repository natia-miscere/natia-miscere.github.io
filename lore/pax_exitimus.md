## Downfall

The event called **Downfall** has changed the political and demographic landscape of Natia Miscere world, many parties involved in the higher echelons of the world tried their best to remedy the situation accordingly. These are the results.

One sentence could describe these outcomes: Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong.

### Heroes of the Crisis

+ **Nene Enoshima**: Having no attachment left whatsoever for the world, Nene takes her three elite battlemaids and retire permanently into her own realm. She now merely travels in between the realms, pranking the deities that rule over them.
+ **Wolf-Alexander Winters**: Having figured out indeed, November was his actual lost sister, distressed over the fact that there are no better ways to go about the Fimbulvinter that has been set, he decides to unleash the Armageddon.
+ **Emily Fields**: Having grown so battered and fatigued psychologically, she decides to remove herself from the affairs of the world. She now resides in the realm of pure fire, isolated from the Natia Miscere world. She seemed to have made sparring buddies with fire elementals and the Lord of Fire that lived originally in that realm. *Although she kinda took their world by force.*
+ **Tamia Riverslane**: Having went completely insane, she no longer exists nor not exist. She's now an enigma without consistency. Thirdborns, Secondborns and Firstborns still roam the world without leader and abandoned by their creator.

### Ecclesiarchs (Druids)

The druids have accepted their failures, and return to sleep along with their leader, the great Beast.

### Clergy

A violent civil war eventually erupts, quelling most of the executives. Whichever executives survive, go into hiding. Whether it's due to guilt or sense of accomplishment, is unknown.

### NAKED

+ **November**: Semi-Permanently seals herself after realizing what she has done under the influence of Empress.
+ **Echo**: Forever tormented in the abyss between the Void and the Reality.
+ **Kilo**: Probably lost in many souls that dot the Netherscape.
+ **Alfa**: District 5, which has now become the most dangerous District to venture into, he rules over the area as AI that is hostile to all things.
+ **Delta**: Offs himself, unable to handle the pressure.

### Sorcerers

+ **Aegis**: Removes himself from this world, never seen again.
+ **Neruvian**: Despite having extremely sour taste in his mouth from the result of his laziness, promptly decides to return to his studies in solitude.
+ **Iris**: Volunteers to become a pawn of Ao, probably to be used as his cleaner of the Worlds.

### Kids

The Star looked at the wrong closet, and the Chariot found them.

## Fimbulvinter / Armageddon / Ragnarok

First disaster upon the world was the Fimbulvinter. Over the course of 3 years, ravaged by crazed Firstborns & Secondborns, and then Moonspawns, much of world's population was quelled, but humanity stoodfast, resisting in pockets, and trying to survive in the cold harsh environment.

However, the gods were not kind. Another disaster followed by the Four Horsemen, The Trumpets and the fury of Mother Nature followed. Whichever community that were formed over the course of 2 years have been eradicated. At this point, the population of humanity was down to mere 1000s.

As the Fimbulvinter neared it's absolute end, the Clergy executives fought, destroying whatever was left that could have protected the humanity from freezing doom. By the end of the civil war.

None of the humanity survived.

## Reboot

Or so they thought. As the last heat generators were frozen to absolute zero, last human community awaited their impending doom. Taking final pity, Emily granted a small candle sized fire that would never extinguish despite the absolute zero. The people hurdle around the fire, doing their best to use their bodies to shield at least the children from the freezing end.

What was mere 24 hours felt like 24 years, and then children survived, all adults were dead. Due to the way how Emily described herself and the lingering warmth that saved them from the doom, the children were almost captured by this new deity in the scene.

With the spark of hope, Star has gathered her last remaining strength to breach into the shelter, and evacuated the remaining survivors out of the collapsing city, the former glory, achievement, progress, all lost as it was buried underneath by the raging earth.

## Aftermath

The humanity still survived, Wolf released all his newly created races into the world, Sisters that were protected in the growing vats were released even after all those chaos. New society and world order was built on top of the peace forged by destruction.
