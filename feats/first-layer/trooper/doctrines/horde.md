## Tier A Perks

### Rear Echelon (A0)

Horde Doctrine Squads gain ability to field Rear Echelon, a small squad of 2 or 3 troops that can be inserted to replace losses if necessary.

### United Humanity (A0)

All pure human Troopers gain +2 HP. Also, Troopers with *Civilian Origins* do not abandon their posts or break easily.

### Conscripts (A1)

If a civilian levy point is discovered, a Horde doctrine officer may levy 2 to 4 troopers from it every week. The amount of troops recruited is dependent on your charisma.

### Inspiring Speech (A1)

As swift action, you make an emboldening speech to raise the morale of your men. The squad members gain either offensive bonus (+1 to attack and damage), defensive bonus (+1 to AC and saves), or utility bonus (a simple bonus of your choice).

This ability can be used CHA mod times a day.

### Field Triage (A2)

A good officer is not afraid to use his man up, but a competent officer does not *waste* his men either. Medics under his command can setup **Casualty Clearing Station**, when 3 casualties are recovered, a squad is reformed, ready to fight.

### Veteran NCOs (A2)

If NCOs exist in your squad, they increase your squad size by +1, and they gain +1 feat point.
