### Flaming Vitality

**Prerequisites:** *CON 18*

Solar Neophyte gains +2 HP per hit die.

### Scorching Ray

Draining their own health, Solar Neophyte fires a ray, dealing *Firebolt* damage to all targets in a line, with a range of 50 ft as standard action. Solar Neophyte drains level x 2 hp per round maintaining this.

### Multibolt

Solar Neophyte can fire multiple *Firebolt*, upto 1+CHA mod bolts as FRA.

### Ember Shield

**Prerequisites:** *CHA 13*

Solar Neophyte uses their life force to fuel a shield. As FRA, they lose their mobility, and converts 50% of the current health + their current aura as an aura field with radius of 15 ft. Any damage that targets allies within the field, the aura field takes instead.

Maintaing Ember Shield is FRA action. If the shield breaks, Solar Neophyte is staggered for 1d3 rounds.

### Hearthfire

**Prerequisites:** *CHA 13*

Warmth can now heal others within touch range.
