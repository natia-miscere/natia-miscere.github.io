### Siege Mode (A1)

As move action, the vehicle/mech can anchor down, doubling its fire range. **This does not double sight range, so spotter may be needed.** Leaving Siege Mode is move action.

### Allied War Machine (A2)

When the vehicle and pilot takes fatal damage, the vehicle/mech is **not** destroyed outright, but disabled. Disabled vehicles/mechs are recovered automatically at the end of the encounter.

However, the enemies can still come by and demolish the wreck for good.

### Valuable Asset Preservation (A2)

Pilots are such a valuable asset, and they are irreplaceable. When a mech is neutralized, the pilot is launched by an escape pod as mech is destroyed.
