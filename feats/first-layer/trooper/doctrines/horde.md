## Tier A Perks

### Rear Echelon (A0)

Horde Doctrine Squads gain ability to field Rear Echelon, a small squad of 2 or 3 troops that can be inserted to replace losses if necessary.

### United Humanity (A0)

All pure human Troopers gain +2 HP. Also, Troopers with *Civilian Origins* do not abandon their posts or break easily.

### Conscription (A1)

If a civilian levy point is discovered, a Horde doctrine officer may levy 2 to 4 troopers from it every week. The amount of troops recruited is dependent on your charisma.

### Inspiring Speech (A1)

As swift action, you make an emboldening speech to raise the morale of your men. The squad members gain either offensive bonus (+1 to attack and damage), defensive bonus (+1 to AC and saves), or utility bonus (a simple bonus of your choice).

This ability can be used CHA mod times a day.

### Field Triage (A2)

A good officer is not afraid to use his man up, but a competent officer does not *waste* his men either. Medics under his command can setup **Casualty Clearing Station**, when 3 casualties are recovered, a squad is reformed, ready to fight.

### Field Command (A2)

An officer needs a vantage point and safe place of operations. If an engineer is availabe in your squad, they may convert a building, emplacement or a portion to trench into a field command. Field command, while active, allows NCO feat to be used multiple times depending on your charisma and rank.

When an officer is stationed in field command, he gains triple sight range and ignores night battle vision penalties.
