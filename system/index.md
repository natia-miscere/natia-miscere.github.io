## Character Creation

Base character creation is more or less the same from Vanilla Pathfinder/3.5e.

This here lists the changes to some character details.

## HP and Buffers

Previous iteration of Natia Miscere gave 3 (4 for late game) general buffer types each character can have. However, due to balance reason, armor was found to be vastly superior to other buffer types, dodge being the weakest. Aura was almost always replaced to Omni buffer later due to character progression, making it quite redundant.

Here are the full rework details of buffer system.

1. **Buffers no longer act as temp hp, but similar to DR.**
2. **To take into account the loss of temp hp, HP die values are massively buffed.**
3. **Buffer values do not grow significatly by level, but are rather enhanced by class features.**
4. **Allows easy stacking of multiple buffers onto one character.**

### Armor

Armor was vastly superior in low level combat due to majority of damage types being physical. The vision of armor will more or less remain the same, granting flat DR against damage. **It no longer grants reduction against physical, rather, it will have DR specification for each damage type. If not mentioned, it means there's no DR against that type.**

This will make DR negation and penetration more valuable.

### Precognition (3rd Layer Dodge)

Precognition will be vastly superior for ranged chars, and reward players for keeping good distance from their foe. Some versions of Precognition will play around with values and wording to make it interesting for melee based DEX chars.

+ Example of Low Level Iteration

Precognition 1 - The owner of such buffer gains +1 Dodge AC bonus for every (opponent's DEX mod - your DEX mod, min 1) range increment the weapon has to fire through.

+ Example of Upgraded Iteration

Precognition 1+2 - The owner of such buffer gains +1 Dodge AC bonus for every (opponent's DEX mod - your DEX mod, min 1) range increment the weapon has to fire through. The owner also gains +2 Dodge AC as base, regardless of circumstance. Being flat footed or flanked or in no cover zone will negate this base dodge bonus entirely.

### Aura

Aura now regenerates certain amount, ratio differing from character to character.

It acts as fat temporary hp shield for more squishier and fragile characters.

### Omni

Omni is now considered combination of all 3 base buffers above.

## Damage Types

In Old Natia, the types of damage was largely divided into physical, magical and true damage. However, due to nature of things, this made physical significantly inferior and magical/true damage was ALWAYS preferred.

Following is the list of damage types and elements.

+ **Mundane**
+ **Arcane**
+ **Fire**
+ **Cold**
+ **Electric**
+ **Air**
+ **Terran**
+ **Psychic**
+ **Temporal**
+ **Sonic**
+ **Holy**
+ **Shadow**
+ **Corrosive**
+ **Divine**
+ **Void**
+ **Pure**

Now, with these types, Mundane will be the most common. More advanced subtypes of the damage can be found, with added quirks and extra properties, but all damage types must fall within one of the major categories.

## Combat Rules

One of the biggest confusion in old Natia, this revision is more like errata/rule clarification of jumbled up firearm combat rules and revampment of stale ranged combat.

### Cover

Cover provided flat AC bonus depending on type, and it was easily outclassed at higher levels.

Cover should provide significant advantage regardless of level, therefore it will now scale with range increments.

+ **Heavy Cover**

A heavy cover is usually a cover that can conceal your entire body with ease. A drink dispensor machine, tall walls, sofas and such furnitures are considered heavy cover.

Provides +2 + (your level / 2) **untyped** bonus to your AC for each range increment.

+ **Light Cover**

A light cover is usually a cover that can coneal parts of your body with ease. A flipped table, bench, small fridge, trash cans and such are usually considered light cover.

Provides +1 + (your level / 3) **untyped** bonus to your AC for each range increment.

+ **No Cover**

Being out in the open. Going prone in No Cover prevents you from being exposed.

Provides no bonus or malus.

+ **Flanked or Exposed**

Being caught in overwatch while moving from No Cover state puts you in exposed state. Also, having your sides or back exposed while in cover puts you in Flanked state. You are also exposed if you stay in No Cover state for more than 1 round.

**Firearm's crit range is increased by FLAT 10, you have the Natia revised Touch AC, which is your normal AC divided by 2.**

So, if you want to live, stay in cover.

### Combat Maneuvers

Much of Vanilla PF combat maneuvers are underwhelming, useless unless your entire char is built around it.

#### Overwatch

+ **Action/Resources Needed:** Standard
+ **Effect:** The character **immediately** ends their turn, and gains an attack of opportunity whenever an hostile target moves **out of the cover into no cover, or from no cover to another cover. Overwatch no longer procs when a target moves within the cover zone.**
+ **Checks Required:** None

#### Hunker Down

+ **Action/Resources Needed:** Move
+ **Effect:** The character gains Heavy Cover bonus from Light cover, **character loses move action next phase.**
+ **Checks Required:** None

#### Suppression

+ **Action/Resources Needed:** Standard & Two Charges of Attack on given Firearm (If the firearm can only attack once per reload, it cannot be used to suppress)
+ **Effect:** Target character suffers **double** range increment penalties, and procs a free Overwatch shot from the suppressor. If the attack roll succeeds, the character also deals minimum 
+ **Checks Required:** Attack/Damage Roll

#### Move Objects

+ **Action/Resources Needed:** Move action, but can also be used as part of charge, move, run or attack action by paying additional swift action.
+ **Effect:** Manipulates the object targetted in specified way.
+ **Checks Required:** CMB check, but STR check may also be necessary if object is large or too cumbersome. May also trigger DEX check if the object is small instead.

#### Reload

+ **Action/Resources Needed:** Move, one magazine.
+ **Effect:** Recharges amount of attacks that can be made with a firearm.
+ **Checks Required:** Sleight of Hand check may be used to reduce the action consumed from move to swift instead. High Sleight of Hand mod allows the character to reload in between attacks as immediate action as well.
