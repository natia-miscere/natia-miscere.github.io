## Tier A Perks

**Unique Passive:** Vehicles can now be granted NCO feat bonus.

### Field Repair (A0)

As full round action, the vehicle can be repaired by the crew from the inside, for 1d8+level, where the level is based on the vehicle controller's, not the commander.

### Expanded Ordinance (A0)

Vehicle/Mechs gain +1/+3/+5/+7 OP, depending on their category.

### Hull Down Tactics (A1)

As move action, the vehicle/mech can dig in, losing its mobility. However, they immediately gain +4 AC and +10 armor. Armor gained this way cannot be repaired. Also, leaving Hull Down position is move action.

### Siege Mode (A1)

As move action, the vehicle/mech can anchor down, doubling its fire range. **This does not double sight range, so spotter may be needed.** Leaving Siege Mode is move action.

### Allied War Machine (A2)

When the vehicle and pilot takes fatal damage, the vehicle/mech is **not** destroyed outright, but disabled. Disabled vehicles/mechs are recovered automatically at the end of the encounter.

However, the enemies can still come by and demolish the wreck for good.
