These Symbiotes have been now revealed to react with **Black Blood**. Branded as failure by Gaya Corp, the primary reason of failure for these symbiotic parasite was due to their lack of materials to synthesize long lasting enough body components that would be durable enough. Having **Black Blood** which contains copious level amount of pure, well refined carbon mass, these Symbiotes can now synthesize powerful body enhancements, at the cost of your humanity.

An individual can have *Body Slots* equal to their CON mod. A Symbiote may freely devolve redundant evolutions to support new ones. Temporary bonuses that can be removed does not provide additional *Body Slots.*

Due to their flammable nature, for each *Body Slot* used to enhance oneself, the infected takes 25% additional fire damage.

When brought below 25% health, the surge of adrenaline and hormones shut down all the limiters of your body parts, operating beyond safe capacity. Every round, you take (level)x2 lethal damage, however, you gain +6 to all your physical ability scores.

You stop taking damage when you fall below 0 hp. You do not go unconscious when below 0 hp. You are not staggered when at exactly 0 hp.

### Hydro-carbon Polymelia

A giant tendril spurts out from the infected's back, granting them an extra limb with a reach of 15 ft. The tendril is pure muscle mass and can be used as bludgeon, dealing 1d12+CON mod physical damage. It is also articulate enough to help the infected climb, leap distances and other miscellaneous stuff.

This extra limb grants additional 8 HP and has hardness of 10.

> Overtime, Polymelia assimilates with the host, returning the Body Slot cost. **However, once fully returned, the Polymelia evolution cannot be removed.**
