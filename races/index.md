Natia Miscere is home to many races, but is predominately inhabited by humans. Below are the list of all current playable races.

## Human

Humanity has thrived on Natia Miscere as the world's most tenacious inhabitant, and forms the vast, overwhelming majority of all the races to exist.

They gain +2 to any racial ability score of their choice.

## Sister

A mixture of organic and mechanical components, the "Sisters" as they have come to be known as were originally intended to be disposable security forces for the Gaya Corporation. 

Liberated by unknown agents of the Third Layer and introduced to the general public during the events of the Downfall of District 9, the Sisters pose a curious blend between man and machine, resulting in something not quite like either of them.

Sisters all share the same, identical genetics, a constructed template from three distinct individuals. Thus, they share the same base features and often look indistinguishable from one another.

Details:

- Unless otherwise specificed, all Sisters are *always* female in gender - this includes subraces.
- Sisters are weak towards EMP or electricity effects, taking double damage or duration effects from them. 
- Sisters may allocate +2 to any two physical ability scores, but these bonuses may not be combined to form a +4 in a single stat. A Sister always suffers a -4 penalty to Charisma.
- Diplomacy and Sense Motive are never class skills for a Sister, no matter what.

### Subraces

#### 1.5th Generation

A vast improvement upon their predecessors, the 1.5th generation are considerably more adaptable and vastly more human than their first generation counterparts.

They still retain some elements of their mechanical makeup, but have much more vibrant personalities and live far, far longer than 1st generation Sisters.

Details:

Inherits the electrical and EMP weakness of 1st generation Sisters.

- 1.5th may allocate +2 to any two ability scores of their choice, including Charisma. They suffer a -2 penalty to a score of their choosing.
- 1.5th may also be revived or repaired if killed but not decapitated or destroyed in the right circumstances. This can happen any number of times if there are sufficient parts to repair them. They sustain no personality damage or deficit in the process.
- 1.5th show remarkable resilience to morale-breaking situations or circumstances of intense fear, gaining a passive +4 to all Will saves. Will is always considered a strong save for them, no matter what.

#### Secondborn

The Secondborn are a nascent manifestation of the Sister-race's endless drive to perfect themselves. Less than a thousand Secondborn exist, but the ones that do are formidable foes and unshakeable allies, merging the best aspects of technologically infused prowess with the flexibility and adaptation of flesh and bone.

Details:

Secondborn are affected normally by EMP and electrical damage due to their enhanced shielding, but are not immune to the former.

**Secondborn are extremely rare and your character's backstory and design should reflect this.**

- Secondborn may allocate +4 to a single ability score of their choice, and suffer no penalty to any stat.
- Secondborn gain a racial bonus called Instant Reaction by default, which renders them unable to be considered flat-footed and may allow them to attempt Reflex saves that may otherwise require extremely fast reflexes. Reflex is always considered a strong save for them, no matter what.

## Pygmalion Doll

The genetic mirror of the mechanical variant created by Doctor Hawkmaw, the original creator of the Sister race, Pygmalion Dolls are still Sisters in the sense that they are manufactured beings, but they are completely bereft of any actual mechanical components. Their obedience is encoded at a genetic level. 

These types of Sisters were extremely prevalent in the First Layer before the Downfall, but most have perished in the time since. They are built to serve, but lack the innate combat reflexes that mechanical sisters have.

Details:

- Pygmalion Dolls have difficulty expressing open emotion outside of preprogrammed responses to tasks related to their work. If they possess high Charisma scores, it is purely a reflection of their appearance. They may never take Diplomacy or Sense Motive as class skills, or even put ranks into them.
- The bioengineered internals of a Pygmalion Doll means that their metabolism and organs are built to repair themselves rapidly. Pygmalion Dolls may not suffer from disease effects and receive +4 to all Fortitude saves, and Fortitude is always a strong save for them.
- Pygmalion Dolls may allocate +2 to any ability score of their choice, similar to humans, but they may never surpass 10 strength under any circumstances.
- Pygmalion Dolls may never be any alignment other than True Neutral. They obey their allocated master without question, though they manifest their own personalities when allowed to roam or instructed to be free. Dolls without a master or who have actively seen their master die must seek out a new one as their prime directive.
